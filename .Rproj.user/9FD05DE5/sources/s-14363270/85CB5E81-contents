# TO DO LIST
# 
# Load a set of NDVI raster for North America divided by weeks
#
# Set migratory population 1 coordinates: LAT = 63.25  LON = -139.41  (northern migrants)
#
# Set migratory population 2 coordinates: LAT = 50.42  LON = -83.52   (southern migrants)
#
# Set final destination coordinates for both populations: LAT = 19.15  LON = -99.11
#
# A very crude estimate of migration biological parameters for warblers is that they can fly
# on average 200-300 miles a day and they leave the breeding grounds around late-August
# and arrive in central Mexico by mid-September, accomplishing migration in about 2-3 weeks.
# We can start modeling the first runs of the simulations by using these parameters.
#
# The end points (lat/lon) of each simulation run can be used as the start points of the next simulation
# run, so we can observe movement progression north-to-south. It is important to leave some room
# for random movements to allow the agents to fall into grid cells with nice NDVI or compatible BIOCLIM values
#
# eBird data and/or niche modeling outputs can provide evidence for "optimal" habitat values
# which we will need to know when setting up the "species" arguments (e.g. species(x= 50, y =50, opt= 90))
# NOTE: you could also edit the "go" function and add more arguments to the species characteristics
# (e.g. species(x= 50, y =50, opt1= 90, opt2= 0.53, opt3= 42.3)) to model more complex and realistic scenarios
# where opt1 is NDVI, opt2 is temp, opt3 is precip, etc.

# It might be okay to use 100 as the number of agents (replicates) to test our simulations for the first time.
# However, this is where we can get fancy and start with 10000 agents, for example, and eliminate those
# that do not fall into suitable grid cells, so we can model mortality and evolution of different 
# migration strategies. You will see that, in particular for those birds that migrate from the 
# Great Lakes area, many agents will end up inside lakes, cities, etc. It won't make any sense
# biologically to allow those agents to continue migration because they would be dead in the real world
# so starting with a >100 number of replicates (points on the map) might be a good idea because 
# that number will be reduced by the time they arrive in Mexico.
