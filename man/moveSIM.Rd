\arguments{
\item{replicates}{Integer, desired number of replicates per generation}

\item{days}{Integer, How many days (timesteps), would you like to model?}

\item{env_rast}{Rasterstack or Rasterbrick with number of layers equal to n_days}

\item{search_radius}{Radius of semicircle to South of current location to search for next timestep (in km)}

\item{sigma}{Numeric, randomness parameter}

\item{dest_x}{Numeric, destination x coordinate (longitude)}

\item{dest_y}{Numeric, destination y coordinate (latitude)}

\item{mot_x}{Numeric, movement motivation in x direction}

\item{mot_y}{Numeric, movement motivation in y direction}

\item{modeled_species}{Object of class "species"}

\item{my_shapefile}{COME BACK}

\item{optimum}{Numeric, optimal environmental value}

\item{n_failures}{How many failures are allowable before agent experiences death (at n_failures+1)}

\item{fail_thresh}{What percentage deviation from optimum leads to death? E.g. .50 = 50%.}

\item{direction}{Character, mig direction, one of "N","S","E","W"}

\item{mortality}{Logical, should low energy levels result in death?}

\item{write_results}{Logical, save results to csv?}

\item{single_rast}{Logical, are you using a one-layer raster for all timesteps?}
}
\value{
A (days X replicates) X 5 dataframe containing data on latitude, longitude,
day, agent ID, and distance traveled between each timestep (in km).
}
\description{
Here, agent mortality occurs when agent fails to achieve suitable raster values
at least 5 days (timesteps) in a row. Agent energy stores are not dynamic, so movement
speed isn't directly affected by quality of raster cells achieved. Results may be analyzed
with `moveVIZ()`. Relies on underlying function `moveSIM_helper`, which is not to be used
alone.
