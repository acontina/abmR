# I. Getting Started

## Installation

To use `abmR`, you must first install it from Github using `devtools` 
and load the library:
```{r}
#devtools: install_github("bgoch5/abmr")
library(abmr,quietly=TRUE,warn.conflicts=FALSE)
```
While this package is still in development, it will be updated frequently, so please
be sure to re-install frequently.

For `abmR` to work, you will need updated versions of the packages `geosphere`, `ggplot2`, `raster`, `rgdal`, `rnaturalearth`, `rnaturalearthdata`, `sp`, `swfscMisc`, and `table1`.

## Requirements for Environmental Data Rasters and Species objects

The modeling functions discussed below require several input objects to work, which
we will discuss here.

a) A shapefile that represents the boundaries for your movements.

Here, we use North America, but whatever region you are interested in modeling
movement over.
```{r}
library(rgdal) #For reading in shapefile
setwd("C:\\Users\\BGOCHANOUR\\Documents\\GitHub\\move-model")
NOAM=readOGR(layer="NOAM",dsn=".")
plot(NOAM,xlim=c(-130,-60),ylim=c(18,75))
```

b) A environmental raster stack

We are currently working on how to attach an example raster to the package, but you can read yours in like this. Here, we use NDVI, but
you may use a raster stack for any environmental variable of interest. Here, we plot
the first four layers of our stack.

```{r}
library(raster)
ndvi_raster=stack("C:\\Users\\BGOCHANOUR\\Documents\\GitHub\\move-model\\NDVI_2013.gri")
plot(ndvi_raster[[1:4]])
```

c) A species object to describe the species that you will model.

This object contains information on origin longitude (x) and latitude (y) as well
as two morphological parameters, `p1` and `p2`. Use ?species for more details.
```{r}
# Define the species class
species <- setClass("species", slots=c(x="numeric", y="numeric",
p1="numeric", p1mean="numeric", p1sd="numeric",p1sign="character",
p2="numeric", p2mean="numeric", p2sd="numeric",p2sign="character"))

# Define your species object. Imagine p1 is wing chord and p2 is mass.
# We are simulating larger than average birds which increases movement speed.
# For more details, use ?species

my_species=species(x=-90,y=45,p1=15,p1mean=10,p1sd=2,p1sign="Pos",
                   p2=10,p2mean=8,p2sd=1,p2sign="Pos")

```


```{r out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
# Small fig.width
include_graphics("OCWA.jpg")
```

# II. Running Agent-based models

`abmR` has two functions for modeling animal migration: `moveSIM` and `energySIM`.
Both `moveSIM` and `energySIM` will output two things: (1) a dataframe of results and
(2) a summary table of input parameters. For more details on how each function works,
please see the documentation by using ?moveSIM or ?energySIM.

## `moveSIM`

```{r render=lemon_print}
moveSIM_results=moveSIM(replicates=1,days=27,env_rast=ndvi_raster, search_radius=375,
  sigma=.4, dest_x=-100, dest_y=25, mot_x=1, mot_y=1,modeled_species=my_species,
  my_shapefile=NOAM,optimum=.5,direction="S",write_results=TRUE,single_rast=FALSE)
head(moveSIM_results$results,30)
moveSIM_results$run_params
```


## `energySIM`

```{r render=lemon_print}
energySIM_results=energySIM(replicates=1,days=27,env_rast=ndvi_raster, search_radius=375,
                  sigma=.4, dest_x=-100, dest_y=25, mot_x=1, mot_y=1,
                  modeled_species=my_species, my_shapefile=NOAM,
                  optimum_lo=.4,optimum_hi=.6,init_energy=100,
                  direction="S",write_results=TRUE,single_rast=FALSE)
head(energySIM_results$results,30)
energySIM_results$run_params
```


# III. Visualizing Results

The output from `moveSIM` and `energySIM` are simple dataframes, so one may easily
visualize their results using custom codes. However, we have provided the following functions that include a set of default plots that you may find useful.

## `moveVIZ`

One may want a basic plot of each agent's movement, as compared to a straight-line
trajectory between the start and target endpoint. This can be obtained by

```{r}
moveVIZ(moveSIM_results,title="MoveSIM results")
```

## `energyVIZ`

The `energyVIZ` function can produce three different types of output, so you must
specify the `type` parameter. For a similar basic plot to the above, use 
`type` = "plot"

```{r}
energyVIZ(energySIM_results,title="EnergySIM results",type="plot")
```

ADD GRADIENT/CONTOUR PLOT SOON

One may also want to create a table to summarize energy, day, and distance, stratified
by energy gain/loss amount. This can be obtained by setting the `type` argument to
"table".

```{r}
energyVIZ(energySIM_results,title="EnergySIM results",type="table")
```
